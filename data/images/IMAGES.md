Description and Download

The FEI face database is a Brazilian face database that contains a set of face images taken between June 2005 and March 2006 at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of FEI in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil. There are 14 images for each of 200 individuals, a total of 2800 images (a morphed version of these images with lots of synthetically modified samples can be found here). All images are colourful and taken against a white homogenous background in an upright frontal position with profile rotation of up to about 180 degrees. Scale might vary about 10% and the original size of each image is 640x480 pixels. All faces are mainly represented by students and staff at FEI, between 19 and 40 years old with distinct appearance, hairstyle, and adorns.  The number of male and female subjects are exactly the same and equal to 100. Figure 1 shows some examples of image variations from the FEI face database.

## MST Swatches

MST Swatches are 10 single-colored rectangles, and each swatch provides the most representative color within its MST group. The swatches are created for researchers who need to use the exact color values of the MST scale for their studies and for reference when running evaluations.
